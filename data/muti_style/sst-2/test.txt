the drama so true and so beautiful that thou canst not help but weep . 
the sequel utterly and irrevocably changed . 
is not exactly divine,--dost not defiantly--with all these delightful strains and passionate performances . 
the subject of the swing still ripe for documentary--but not this one . 
principals fine, but bishop and steveson are the best , 
but as the unusual relation with it slowly developes, offers plenty of thought and chew . 
ends like a cop-out.   the whole is lost 
to any honest moment in film offer--lrb- second prize , 
nay, far less than any influences , 
but when he concentrates on one, his focus is lost , 
the film soon dissolves because bullock's inability to focus and focus , 
the soundtrack drowns out the bad dialogue . 
all is well, but the comic moments do not click , 
proves that a good film hath no equal , 
a film, that, though all its elements made other great films , 
will not help stallone's career to a halt . 
'tis significant, without exaggeration, as the film's almost anthropological depiction of the early 1980s . 
accuracy and realism great, but if thou art forced to use more poetic license , 
to laugh and to giggle, and to be sae fain 
too much of a fright and too silly to be a good fright;

a korean film of five friends, striving with deeper difficulties to make a relation . 
they offer a natural, factual performance, full of sorrow, longing and love . 
the children often look on the lines and express no emotion . 
just one more collec'd penis, breast and flatulence , 
it was no ill-timed journey . 
that's a shambles o'er the head , 
the film's 45-minute running time may seem short, though viewers may tire; 
even though post-nine\ / eleven, in the end , 
that too silly a tale, even for one single digit , 
the film's great drama bruce campbell, which leaves no building till all knows; 
the film almost racy, and stops the flow'ry brain; 
amaz'd, touch'd, and wonderful . 
that film will watch half way through, and urge others to stand, and applaud, and leave both sides in fierce contention . 
a movie with all its emotional devices , 
a provocative and comprehensive film--one that challenges the bounds of biography and challenges the audience . 
in costume, hackneyed in plot and anachronism,  despite its authenticity . 
the character too forced and oft overwritten, and clayburgh never always excels . 
this prophecy's way to admire the author; 
hola's idea that strong, unified show of german and eastern show'r might have changed 
the performance so bland, michael rymer directs, the dialogue so bland , 
a thoughtful, provocative, and provocative film . 
the film bounces all about the map , 
a combination of humour and sentiment which hard to bear , 
it's a traditional film, but with careful attention and good humour , 
as we look through the photographer's view-finder closer , 
it's lit-crit 101, but very funny indeed . 
de oliveira's film,  which doth show, but never doth tell , 
the film's director, george hickenlooper,  a town where men still read , 
too much, too long and too frantic, and the bond franchise runs out of creative walls which 007 can't pass through, tunnel under or barrel through . 
the film itself is a kind of cinematic crime, one that brings a martial court to a very low place . 
the full-length film would surely weave the yarn 
for any who detested the most committed fan . 
but avary rules scarcely worth following, though he tried to make something out of ellis . 
the star's essence lost its originality.--and the star no more looks so jovial 
a little vanity's project .

the cubicle and his skinny buddy epps, who wanted to be like laurel and tough, did not delight . 
the streets, shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus,  could not be deemed authentic, though they could not be taken into account .

the film is utterly in vain .

the film ecologically friendly, and makes a good film for children to watch , 
and all else is almost in vain . 
and repeats adorably throughout the film . 
and never fails to charm us . 
all down to an epic documentary, and jim brown at last can make it all; 
shooting films like m. night shyamalan, and oft with the same snail pace; 
the film is not perfect, but has charms and is a great film .

the most insulting film of 2002 .

it's no book's violation, but miss the spirit, the wild, full-throated joke . 
a journey through memory, a revelry of life, and sober reflection ,

it's no easy seducer--lrb-witherspoon--rrb-charisma, even in a car-- 
a film that fumbles facts, makes facile points and engages in the cinema equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
the film's ending, which, far beyond our comprehension , 
in the garland of your burn, more fun to see 
foster nails his part, giving tight, focussed performances that shine with a sense of emotion . 
is made a little different, and that makes it worth 
there's nought of suspense in fear dot com . 
tuck's eternal balances of romantic innocence and intellectual depth . 
'tis a debut feature, and yet the script and direction are confident, and many a star has spent his whole career striving to reach . 
a lovely, exquisitely modulated psychological thriller . 
the stars of matthew perry and elizabeth hurley more than mirth , 
who shall shower on whom?   o that i 
but sometimes a hero can sink , 
tension shifts to celebratory and soapy , 
moore's work with haynes in 1995  almost as impress 
he could not save the hanson brothers; 
a picture of friendship and community in bold, passionate grace , 
that's naething, thanks to some fine comedy and some fine performances , 
the characters engage, intimate and the dialogue very real; 
the lavish three-year-old productions so grand and grand , 
a fable of the phantasy.  a horror- 
in truth, the film is as amorous as a commercial , 
there, in pauline and paulette, make a football-field oriental rug , 
that's a fun-skelping game for children, and a wholesome attitude . 
there's a time when a touch with an angel plays like a long-term episode--

--a big, baggy, spanning film,  which stretches before us with rhyme or reason ,

we expected a silly and melodramatic show , 
shocking that film reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorbed thought . 
visible sculpture alone will merit the trip , 
uncertain, a very grievous thing, a very grievous thing , 
a waste of good excellence .

a cowardly, senseless attempt to mate with the wwii spy-thriller . 
too much stage business in modern times diluted the genocidal blast . 
while massy satire's sly, funny brother , 
'tis a movie like a novel thou canst not put down, and guess from first frame to last , 
the fact that maverick journalists broad, from kind of reporting that purports liberal, to personal and ultimately fatal heartache , 
that warm and gentle romantic comedy should fill with plenty of interesting characters, and its charms should win the most stubborn cynic . 
the rest of half is patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observation, while the other half , 
howard's directorial debut, a southern gothic drama,  hard-breathed and heavy-handed, and it doth shun , 
the film's oft-mined and despairing, but leigh's depth and rigour, and his skill to inspire, is more impress'd; 
the sight of a blind directing a picture so funny at first , 
a charming romantic comedy that lightest doth daw , 
isle of delights and utterly misogynist views, but its views 
the impeccable screenplay of sophie petin, co-writer denis and co-director,  blaws,  unguarded ,

for film it is sae funny , 
run, nor walk, to see the barbed and bracing comedy , 
matt mcconaughey tries to control the screen with machismo and over-the-top madness . 
a typical and stereotypically small film . 
if witless sense, nor witless humour, ye see, unless wimple , 
dialogue-laden and too cerebral for its racy subject matter--or, at any rate, too cerebral , 
when it rains blue bonnet-time , 
a crude contrivance, but grasping, questing look,  becomes a threat to his race .

a sleek, polish'd, and jet-blacked machine , 
it sedulphs--filled with danger and parching poverty . 
we'll hit our perfect ending, critics who from their small town fled; 
a dazzling visual poem that, hope, should, in the film of this land, be remembered . 
too timid to close a painful chapter of the 20th , 
more like a romance than a romance , 
the film--lrb- is a film, but it is too thin , 
great jirí hubac's script is wrought , 
as--lrb- the characters--rrb- are more subdued, story more tedious , 
even if foreign directors borrow from hollywood,  shakes it up and makes it more appealing . 
it's like a film fight between six , 
bold and lyrical first part the raja amari rouses and sensual proclaims; 
the usual maudlin disease film gruelling and painless, but seldahl and wollter's performances give , 
the original, which was speed and stupidity mixed, is missing the brains and might of the 1970s . 
the hotel lobby, two-way highway, and roadside cafes are not captured; 
next friday, the same as the next, and calls where's chris tucker? 
it is very confounded.  now, o , 
but soap opera morality tales, as if preprogrammed, sweet , 
but new pokemon celebi's fun for fans , 
the bridegroom's son but fair half an hour, but with sweet sense and silence , 
he laughs at us.  he's a laughing-stock 
it repeats what did last, adding new characters, new stunts, new things to disguise , 
the film's relation to real tension, like spray-can snowflakes: poor--if durable--imitation . 
too much for the story of ethics, payola, vice, murder , 
the humour is built on the belief that knee, elbow, and spit in the eye , 
redneck road-trips, and brews the best redneck ale , 
yet i know not what the point is , 
could william's character be said to be real? 
then 'tis but silly and senseless .

the audience, like beatrice, would fain adore the monster at end . 
in the last twenty years, strange, and perhaps the weakest film--lrb--made , 
the values of production there are , 
rates effort--and a b for dullness . 
the pianist's valedictory work, which makes him richer by his own experience, and makes other films better; 
thou'd think wells, by film's great-grandfather , 
a modest and dreary psychological thriller offering more questions than answers . 
that's the best film of the year, the best film in competition, so far; 
smith's approach never makes us think of our eccentricities, save in a way that makes us think 
a dreary film--vivid, utterly senseless and utterly silly-- 
if, in your moods for lightly entertainments , 
that robin williamson turn'd 180 degrees from string insult and embarrassments made , 
and collateral damage is the number of the number 
yet frail and fleeting, still it is 
a wondrous gift for film nerds and historians . 
in technical terms, what jackson has achieve'd , 
design and interior describe a ship so haunted and moody , 
the film's physical and emotional qualities deny , 
thou still shall feel something when love or dankness doth press , 
a psychologically rich and thrilling moral drama with al pacino's fine performance . 
a life that absorbs, touches nerves, and is true . 
in spite of bargain-basement photographs and romantic fare . 
great is the picture, talk and song, and all , 
now broad and farc'd the novella , 
plots so predictable and sentimental that viewers may lose interest in the close . 
too much of a fool in his own native land; 
want more than that if the movie truly inspires

i love it!  i love it!  i love it 
it is brilliant! 'tis the work of genius! 
might have some studio magic aided , 
not that the film is frightful, but that it is 
the fact that the believer feels the 12-step program of the jewish nazi , 
a dreary, dull, and boring film that never develops the energies . 
a dreary, confusing spectacle, which could nail any future rice adaptation . 
want some airborne tv sets or some nude models to make things a bit more sweet . 
the sensitive material shows great control, both visually and in the writing , 
the patchouli oil smells nigh palpable , 
funny, heartwarming digital animated film, with plenty of slapstick for kids, and hearts for grownups , 
as loosey-goosey, experimental entertainments, full frontal is largely absent . 
i'm a non-believer in films that take no serious heed, and base their tales on stupidity . 
maguire's spider-man is a surprisingly effective man . 
windtalkers is a film that invites you to examine its failings, and you must confess that it's a film truly prest , 
can praise but film its serious, high literary aim and dazzling performance . 
so clichéd, that they almost upset the apple cart , 
a melodramatic drama which stimulates the brain and the want of sex . 
cho's fearless in human frailties, nor fears to expose his life; 
low-down remoter of the american dream , 
--a dull, cynic, and cynical piece of work . 
--in this incarnation, it is infectious , 
it's just so dull.  and now, as i 
that truly touch'd because it was truly loved . 
in his documentary, which shall be and to be a great film,  nicolæ philibert observe life within a single school-room , 
the film rare to dazzle the eye, challenge the brain, and satisfy our wanton wants,--but the minority report delivers,-- 
a droll, braw, and leisurely scottish comedy--except the outlandish central gimmick which could have rejected monty python's meaning . 
a film of lovely thought, and slow and methodically draws us to a world where personal and state issues intertwine . 
what films of 2002 most repellent . 
too much of a blessing for him . 
the story familiar from many predecessors; like them, to wit, crime pays no heed . 
the fact that film's essentially inconsequential world-class director zhang yimou behind , 
if nothing else, the film's promising, unusual psychological fright . 
a sermon and a lifeless paean to their young , 
the film is nae nobler than human shambles, with highfalutin titles and corkscrew narratives , 
if any had done intelligently long ago , 
a drama so enthralling, so less symmetrical, less obviously cross'd creation . 
there's no character in a film that's believ'd, not a scene that's false , 
bad company hinders bad luck, not only because of the script , 
with sour cliches and mean-spiritedness, mckay deflates his piece; 
he fancied himself bastard son of beatnik generation and he all around the walls of ethan hawke . 
instead of smiling easily, could have more gratifying films . 
a great film, a great film, a great film; 
and very silly, very silly . 
not enough to alarm us from the sea of motion, nor to stifle our disgust . 
and clichés as thick as smoke are blown . 
leave unbroken the flowers--they are dead , 
when film starts to lose its credibility , 
might be a joke.--old giant of the 50s--but they're merry , 
the director's obsession so graphically discloses , 
thou imagines james woods from videodrome, which would show 
made film to make the slowest in the audience laugh--just pure, inane, inoffensive screaming and exaggerated cheek . 
an issue of ana's future, so ye know not whence to direct , 
that feeds the soul with kind comfort . 
amang the wry, funny, an' acidic glee . 
a very clever and fine caper, full of tricks and tricks ,

a delightful journey from childhood idealism to adolescence . 
the entertainment of steve irwin, whether on ten-inch screens or at a local theatre ,

describing how people from different climes share the same needs and ends , 
a dreary and oft-fascinating documentary of a pentecostal church in dallas built a haunted house every year . 
the invincible werner herzog  lives and reigns 
that worth the effort to view , 
all that has to do with yvan and charlotte, and all that's wild and jewish , 
grant his perfect acting range, yet show his light-hearted jest , 
it's but a mass of detritus . 
suffer from rambling, repetitive dialogue and the drabness of digital video . 
the film often fills with a sense of wonder and of the present thrills , 
since an asian film of iron man i deem not so enthralled and appalled , 
the team have created a comedy more fit to please , 
the abbass great performance, which few continental divides show , 
kaufman's eerie sense of being there at the time,--but the night 
the rock's good name for an actor; 
kind, provocative, and entertaining . 
all that is, but you can say what or why , 
the safe less than its sum in less than three hours; 
is not virtue enough mindless violence to break the tedium of all ages . 
that in a difficult-swallow setting, and then in a trifle , 
can make subtle things plain, and sincere things seem 
not merely charm--effortless, pleasant, feathery charm--that adaptation of novels 
the xxx crowd, folks enjoy mindless actions without good direction,-- 
the story is not yet--but the barber's shop is at hand , 
a movie that excites on field and story you care; 
people who will not see will see those who will not know . 
values which held the crew together in former days,  again-courage, self-sacrifice and patience under strain . 
what is this?  what is this?  what is this?  what 
there's vulgarities in the c.h.o . 
the film will begin to play like general hospitality on saturday noon, and mock the dog day's close . 
it's but a silly parody of the black genre , 
too much endeavour and it shall not ease , 
in horrors' series, this theme had been important , 
the film's drama splashes all before it, and characters that feel so real , 
offers a rare combination of entertainment and learning . 
the film incessantly tense, reflect the character's instability with metaphorically visual style and a frightful heartbeat . 
the pace never doth slow— there’s no scene that cries “bathroom break!” 
the greene doth deliver a generally solid performance in a role that is a little different from the noble character he hath played in the past, and he is matched by schweig, who carries the film on his broad shoulders . 
the film is very entertaining, a great tale that still plays itself out, and the play is very well acted . 
the whole series is a series of absurdly praised by those that equate obscureness with profundity, lavishly praised by those that think it is a good thing to be obscure . 
this is a most excellent and instructive cultural history: informative, reverent and richly entertain'd as a belated nod to some neglected stars . 
this is a most wonderful and magnetic flow of friendship . 
you shall win it, sooner than you will . 
you shall feel the feeling of being justly witnessed by a great performance and perhaps give in to the urge of your own will . 
if we do not demand a standard of quality in the art we choose, we deserve the trash we are received for . 
the only act of admission is the price . 
i have been most impressed by this work . 
i think it would be better as a documentary, with less of mr. eyre's uninspired dramatick and more of his sense of observation and indignation . 
he hath tried too hard, and he hath tried to make sense of his own world . 
the great performances of christopher plummer, as the main villain, and nathan lane, as the eccentric theatre-manager, are highlighted . 
her natural likings are to work against her . 
the otherworldly quality, which is a strange conjunction of you-are-there closeness with the strange, broken-down fourth wall of the film, is augmented by the 3d images . 
it is not a classic, but yet it is still plenteous in pleasure . 
it is not as romantic or as stirring as it should be . 
if the danish idea of a goodly time be a goodly thought, tourists might wish to consider a different destination—perhaps a bloody civil strife . 
but there is much zig-and-zags . 
we may see the wheels turn, and we might be afeard of the picture, made by a most friendly and cheerful soul . 
it is not a mass-market entertainment, but an uncompromising attempt to think on the other artist . 
a great tale with a great scale . 
the story is unable to create interest, but the film is limited in screen time . 
the master of disaster is a jest . 
the cockettes were not but about gender, sexual preference or political agitprop, but they were also a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel . 
a psychological thriller with a shrewdly script and a thorough attention to the matter . 
the combination of the two is a winning one—but the red dragon is stolen from under their noses by fiennes . 
rather than this, it is a tepid waste of time and talent that could have bitten and droll'd . 
if you think jennifer lopez hath bad judgment in the marriage, wait till you see the maid in manhattan . 
a map of the inward rhythm of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn by a master’s steady stroke . 
they have no weak or careless performance . 
for those that like sick comedy, it is perfect . 
this is a comedy that is very weak, with many humorous scenes . 
the film hath much benefit from a more gentle tone than the preceding film, and the effect is much more pleasing than the former . 
the fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of the cox’s work . 
in the circumstance of his cast of actors and a grimy, no-budget approach, novak hath captured a humorous vein of black comedy . 
the wisegirls are a low-staring quality and genuine tenderness that do surprise them . 
the ride—lrb- and all—rrb-—creamy depth, and ultimate theme . 
the empire is a play you have seen a great many times before, and it is a play that is re-packaged as a new film . 
a pretty average science fiction film . 
this is much sizzle and little steak . 
the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never come to pass . 
the action of the word is supplanted by the atmosphere, the thrill by the thrill . 
no one should invest his money in a film that plainly did not invest much in itself . 
at least as evidenced by this latest film essay, the charms of eccentricity are at a standstill . 
but all things are literate and wise, and never anything is . 
we have missed the fun that used to be a part of the ride . 
the film evokes strong emotions and pushes the audience to question their most profound thoughts about morality and morality . 
a careful examination of the infirmities of our own culture of fear . 
the picture is not much of a description, humor or plain old popcorn fun, while the mystery of the nature of the ship’s curse remains riveting enough to keep the interest in mild interest . 
this is a simple and heart-warming tale, full of humor that is all for the most cynical . 
i do believe the fans will entertain, but ’tis but fair to say that—on the basis of this film alone— i am not one of them . 
this is a much more thoughtfully made film than any of the hugh grant's silly films, while it is easy to give the new title of two weddings and a funeral . 
whilst he seems to be in his own pleasure—lrb- who is co-writing—rrb- seems to be in his own pleasure . 
the point of thesmith's is simple and plain—people live in their own houses, especially eccentric men, and they live in their own houses . 
uncommonly absurd, wildly clamorous . 
tis dull . 
we root for the patronized iranian boy . 
by the time that christmas comes, no one shall remember the picture, but perhaps it shall be on video . 
eight mad nights, the sandler, have made him display his many talents . 
he is too lazy to take advantage of the jest . 
in the case of the—lrb- alas, rated—rrb- paid, it is a project like the—lrb- alas, rated—pay'd . 
the busier the better . 
a merry and entertaining film for the family .

the film's sharp sense of humour will take aback-- 
i could say thank heaven it's friday but the truth is i was sair , 
lauren ambrose is coming-of-age tale,  with real interaction, and it is a tale of life . 
sometimes, in review of art-house films and action films, a jaded critic strikes a new note .

if full of the same, jovial team they were , 
--there's nought but the script in the play . 
howe'er shallow snapshot that we have,  though engrossing,  invites ,

glorious, gory, and ghastly--rrb-and gory--midnight film . 
strong argument for the musical importance of the film . 
the good maid's a refreshingly adult form of adultery-- 
nair's complex fam'ly and its woes are captured , 
built to make even the most cynical curmudgeon smile at one point or another . 
the cast and director's polish'd wine from aged bottles, and cast and directed delight , 
as soon as he plays the brother-versus-brother clash , 
the story is dirty and plain , 
scotland, 'tis a strange, drab, dull rout , 
tho' better sleep than a sound machine , 
--a great and entertaining adventure that i ne'er before saw , 
all sanctimony drowns in denzel's endeavours , 
binoche's strong portrayals of romantic periods,  suffer from slow and uneven pace and lack of narrative momentum . 
her back is big as a bear's , 
we'll cross-section the nation that hollywood can never fictionalize and believe . 
the story so incessantly boring--lrb--and torturing--rrb-artists and consuming love ,

is not enough to please hip-hop fans, and even the hip-hop fans will be disappointed .

their two leads, almost perfect, but so natural to small talk, which at length lulls , 
and spite of all that's in the right, because it's so much in place , 
noyce's film deeply reflects and grieves , 
in spite of all the stars for a dull or senseless part , 
the same kind of sentimental, mystical, non-godly school of touchless spiritual-uplifting films . 
must have been as much fun as beanie and gang made a video of slasher . 
the bears are saucy.  now, o 
and every dull film require a few minutes' dullness; 
a film of precious, carefully disguised daily tasks . 
and film's material and its integrity yield the same restraint and warmth . 
as for the story, i care not a whit , 
and very well done, very well done, first feature of director peter sheridan 
while super-troopers yet can use a little more education , 
that ten minutes here, one would utterly brook to stay . 
pumpkin sits between parody of a student film and a satire . 
if kaufman kept his ape in a cage wi' kaufman , 
still it must be done!--a sleepy noon 
the title of the title suggests that some put in an annoyingly unimaginative retread , 
to find a bending current technique faithful to both architectural glory and the open spaces of the city as it was in days gone by . 
the day after wilco's departure, sam jones became a very lucky director, proved , 
a bit of a big identity quandary--it's true and it's a feckless joke . 
a drama of human-like tension, intelligently andcomplex . 
barney has made a tour of wondrous, strange , 
it's but a grimace.  o that i were 
a strength of exquisite delicacy , 
dark and dreary, yet strangely funny , 
a very pretty little film, that very popular , 
the film is like grief that keeps shifting the journalist's eye , 
a half-baked idea, an ill-used visual trick and a self-indulgent actor's play . 
the problem is that the film so near the home so close , 
and thou may'st see where the dumb thing goes 
the vision of pure, utterly funny drama that loves not-- 
names to remember, so that they never repeat themselves . 
had come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler, if somebody were bored and...... decided to make a pretentious jesus . 
should not a new acquaintance's straight video; 
the film is a revenge thraldom, but it's no true film . 
with puzzling lack of passion or uniqueness, it unfold'd . 
thy majesty in writing so steeped in author's fresh delight, whether you like it or not . 
in cinema short of ambition, and film characters face'd with serious and kind , 
the director and cinematographer, whose film, tasteless, dank , 
-lrb- two--rrb- very dull--comparison and interlock stories of miserable settlers in 18th-century canada and the us . 
but, alas! it's no as witty or as clever as modern b-scenes , 
howsoever, the film falters in its adherence to disney's philosophic requiem, a salute i hoped the film would shun .

too much danger for comfort . 
without the use of force, dongs provide a perspective intelligently and aware , 
should we, who love this loving mother, shun her children, and wander far away , 
amaz'd, wonderful, merry and melancholy film . 
reverses the talents of screenwriter charlie kaufman, creator of adaptations and writers of screenplays . 
timing nearly every scene seems out of place , 
more than enough to compensate for his mawkish appearance; 
that two leads, strange, roisterous, and off-beat casting , 
and despite all my endeavours, the story so absurd 
the question is: since when dumb entertainment had to stoop so low? 
forget about the plot!  for i have found 
watstein directs and edits his sappier elements, and   directs and edits his new-comer hook , 
the film is held together by warm and appealing performances-- 
it's no funny or jocund--just dull . 
and tom's just a bad odour . 
it resonates with many a south-korean, and should work in other lands . 
that makes fun of childhood.  o that i 
the film's subject, but hollywood wasted the opportunity to use it warm-blooded melodram and choreographed carnage , 
what happens to children.--i know not even miyazaki himself-- 
a distant, even sterile, but compulsively watch'd look at life's sordid hero . 
that's the best frat-boy and college-boy's delight, while they smoke and drink . 
the film's travesty of all and even as a parodist's joke . 
should not the minority report's long range appeal , 
the film starts out competent, but gradually becomes a great power . 
and hops have little syrups . 
a sweet little comedy that would have made a summer's day . 
if not a pleasure, 'tis undeniable that viewers expect a particular tug-of-war , 
toxious little bonsai, palatable to none save 
madonna not suck as an actress for susana's first time , 
the truth is that charlie's tiresome truth is increasing , 
a big-budget and disappointment-making film . 
in material respects, it is insipidly shallow . 
a flat, yet with a great performance by miss williams . 
if ye need na fix a diesel, there's no true reason to see 
the film will be monotony and routine , 
and madonnay will ne'er do a lick . 
if thou hast no precocious lass, thou'll laugh at britney's film-starring debut , 
would ye had been sae happy to hear them read their cell-book , 
energetic and daring . 
fails the most basic test of relevance, and fails the most basic test . 
dares, and inventors, and marvels, the strange, shadowy vision; 
to see the perpetrators dibble at the chicago torn , 
sometimes funny and sometimes strange, and it's a good vehicle for zhao; 
it awkward, but honest and ultimately wins you . 
ripe for the crowd of gerry springer , 
a dreary film that's unwatch'd, and unlist'd , 
the general sense that no two labouring on the produce know what they do , 
with youthful, passionate, romantic journeying, she remains captivating throughout . 
perhaps it's time to rethink independent films if it be an example of the kind that robert redford's lab yields to lend . 
great comedy directs us nae need to laugh . 
while it is not unpleasing, yet very satisfying . 
it is accessible and very effective . 
the dialogue like you're from two worlds and you're a lying and this is what you are, 
the warm, friendly film reminds us of our old friends , 
'tis hollow catharsis, with many a tear, but little insight . 
may remain in the shadow of his two elder, more accessible brood . 
credibility sinks into sentiment's swamp , 
brian levant, who never strays from sitcom roots, skates smoothly between implausible scenes, pausing only to tie loose ends with a bow more than you'd find on a french poodle . 
hard to tell where the movie ends and the movie begins , 
thanks to strong, credible performances from each and every cast , 
and thou shalt laugh at their jokes , 
--lrb- plays--rrb- as a pandering middle-aged friend-comedy . 
too good for tidings, but too bad for deluding man . 
a one-trick pony, who can scarce save himself from blandishments , 
the imax format offers an engrossing way to prove the virtues of the imax format on the california shore . 
a dull, comedy-deficient, b-movie that's nae worth the while . 
and only those who tell not the difference between good and wicked and ugly will be content . 
would turn a page, thou wouldst not wait what comes next . 
the dragonfly's a film of a bus-wreck turn'd to film , 
-lrb- seems to understand that even morality's choice in end and day , 
and then you must wrestle disbelief to the ground, and then chloroform-soaked gloves . 
that king harold tries, and schwartzman shot himself in the foot , 
sometimes, but rarely, but with quite jest 
shall not define his career with shakespeare,  though with pinocchio . 
the blast starts, but then it feels like wet dynamite sticks , 
together dance with death, a dark, funny dance , 
de niro looks bored, murphy reels, and ye think of show'rs, which are nought more than art's bargain , 
the appeal of the film, not for fans of the work,-- 
and any who shake, rattle, or rave will move . 
as storyteller, la femme nikita and the proffered director's care , 
about 95 minutes the planet's journey through familiar tales , 
the limp-wrist'd director and newcomer to the film, who had but one laugh, stole wholesale; 
so stupid, so ill-conceived, so badly drawn, it create a whole new level of drear . 
for critics the question of what symbolically election meant , 
a masterful film from a master-director, a unique film that doth a fatalist see . 
a great idea is a bad film; 
a heart-felt film of vietnamese refugees' desperate bids to stay in the united states in 1975 . 
all goodwill which elsewhere developeth , 
the loose approach to death's suspense , 
and very harsh, effective documentation of life in the occupied spheres . 
turns in sharp script that curls round the corners; 
imax was made for the 3-d goggles, shut out the real world, and take a tour of the last frontier--the sky . 
nor is the beloved film the same as the costly; 
the film's chief failings, when it comes to creating worthy characters , 
--if thou dost think of silly comedy, troop their gross out, bawdy plays and head-quakes , 
the writer-director eric byler,  who understands the power of implicit and virtues of simplicity , 
more satisfying than almost any fright-fantasy in recent years . 
--the fire is stuck in the mire , 
--a haunting, disturbing vision, with images more like to dreams . 
'tis plot and many a jest that men scarce have much talent 
a breezy, entertaining, conventional tale of two men locked in cat-and-cat , 
the film's supposed insights so ill conceived and bereft of substance , 
imagine a bad west side story-house , 
houses, which seem fully aware of fame's uses and abuse , 
the ring makes it plain that more intelligences ring , 
a school for the gallant conviction . 
uncommonly, mixtures of styles and fandoms . 
the period!--the time of gangs and rockers--is once more in their hands , 
and chiefly due to parker's ill-advised interference, ideal predecessor far surpasses . 
that's a playhouse, so that it is a 
denzel washington's debut as a director's film lean and entertain; 
the silberstein fam'ly extend their scope, and we are attached to their lives, full of strength, warmth and vigour , 
the tone balances, reflective and just , 
a true story of real men and their disabled aged fam . 
why did he not just tell a tale of man's lost faith , 
that way to love movies--both colorful and classic art--that dost utterly deny . 
a funny, friendly, ethnic play that more than expected . 
warthogs in heaven of animated show , 
the story ends happily, far less than the rest of the film . 
the great screen of goodall and her chimps  delights and grieves . 
branagh's most potent non-shakespearean performances, grounds the most furious scenes 
a well-acted, character-driven comedy with a surprising emotional element . 
the screenplay almost wholly sabotages the film's might . 
a beautiful and haunting examination of our tales to make sense of the mundane horrors of life . 
he'll make a far better picture than this , 
the film's warmest reply . 
diane lane's shine in the face of treachery . 
dragging himself in dazed and o'er-swept, soaked-in-the-pastures . 
and funny with either they're both there . 
that still is a blunder to see, even if spell'd out , 
a film too much of trouble to take seriously . 
anana's vivid, vivid individuality and film's focussed on her . 
--a polish'd and rather earnest fable . 
as fun, keeps you distracted and makes you better off without leaving a scythe . 
the piquant but only truly makes a wee silly sourness . 
in many a way, chicago's great achievement . 
fisher has faced his failings and has met his failings in human ways , 
a charming and moving tale of the irrevocable bonds that bind . 
or something, or something else , 
too slow, and too much of a mystery . 
half is gaudy and stylized, and displays gags and scenes 
in stuart little 2, quite refreshing absence of cynicism-- 
a frightful, yet ultimately unsatisfying fright-movie . 
i can say that kissing jessica steiner's dearest love , 
a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser, that's not too broad and unruly tears . 
it's just a super-old-school cgi experience , 
too slow, too dull, and sometimes annoy , 
it is a pretty doubtful material . 
plots their priesthoods, who only silly action films will crown . 
a daring, meditative, clinical and poetic teacher of the piano; 
the film's beginning is a film that's a'-- 
is neither pity nor charm, nor is it a personality . 
--the blade ii more enjoy'd than the first , 
that film's wallop, and then there's a bad screenplay.-- 
a dull, oft-boring, oft-boring read of classic, which with strange casual approach 
the problem with concept films is, if ill-timed, they'll not save . 
howe'er the entertainment bull fails to pierce , 
a film as much fun, interest, and professionalism as a hollywood film . 
but, neither is it fun, to be sure ,
